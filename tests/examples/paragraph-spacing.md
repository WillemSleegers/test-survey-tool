# Paragraph Spacing Example

This example demonstrates how blank lines between text paragraphs are preserved to create proper paragraph spacing in Markdown.

## **Introduction Section**

TOOLTIP: """
This is a multi-line tooltip that explains the section.

It can contain multiple paragraphs separated by blank lines.

Each paragraph will render with proper spacing.
"""

Welcome to this survey about paragraph spacing. This first paragraph introduces the topic.

This second paragraph is separated by a blank line and will render as a distinct paragraph with proper spacing above it.

This third paragraph demonstrates that multiple paragraphs can be used to organize information clearly.

## **Question with Context**

Before we ask the question, let's provide some important context:

First, understand that proper paragraph spacing improves readability.

Second, blank lines in the source file are preserved between text content.

Third, this makes it easy to structure your survey content naturally.

Q: What is your name?
TEXT

## **Multiple Text Blocks**

Each text block between questions maintains its internal paragraph structure:

Paragraph one in this section.

Paragraph two in this section.

Q: Do you find paragraph spacing helpful?

- Yes, very helpful
- Somewhat helpful
- Not helpful

More explanation can follow after questions:

This text comes after the question and maintains proper spacing.

It can also have multiple paragraphs for clarity.

## **Complex Example**

TOOLTIP: """
Tooltips also support multiple paragraphs.
